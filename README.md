# Vocabulary Trainer
This is a vocabulary training tool with a customizable spaced repetition algorithm to ensure optimal retention of the vocabulary.
The tool supports automatic creation of decks using the most commmon words in a target language as well as automatic translation of a deck to another language.
In the case of incorrect translations the tool provides a fast way to edit, delete and add vocabulary during practice.
Finally the tool will keep a running score of the accuracy of each individual vocabulary item to ensure that words with a higher accuracy are prompted less frequently.
